AZ 301 Exam Prepration (Azure Solution Architect)

Translate business requirements into secure,scalable and reliable solutions. should have experience in networking, virtualization, identity, security, business continuity, disaster recovery, data management,budgeting and governance.

candidate must pro in development, devops or Administration

Topics covered on the exam:
Determine workload requirements
Design for identity and security
design a data platform Solution
design a business continuity strategy
design for deployment,migration and integration
design an infrastructure strategy

Section1: Determine workload requirements
    Gather information and requirements
        Identity compliance requirements  (Study Tip: Go through Azure Architecture Center: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ )
            .Accessibiltiy requirements
            .Availability requirements
        Recommend changes during a project
            .Evaluating projects and services to align with a Solution
            .Creating a test scenarios
     Reference Architecture: serverless event processing using Azure functions or serverless web application

    Optimze Consumption strategy
        Optimze app service
        Compute
        Network
        Identity
        Storage Costs
    different optize strategy
        cost analysis on each services--> how much we are spending
        pricing calculator: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/ 
        if you are going for migration then use the Total Cost of Ownership(TCO): https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/ (migrating from on-prem to cloud)

    Design an auditing and monitoring strategy

        .Define logical groupings (tags) for resources to be monitored
        .Determine levels and storage locations for logs
        .Plan for integration with monitoring tools
        .Recommend appropriate monitoring tools for a Solution
        .Specify mechanism for event routing and escalation
        .Design auditing for compliance requirements
        .Design auditing policies and tracability requirements

Every resource in azure has the option for the tagging, using this tags we can identify or budget caculations, events, functions for automation, expiry date, apply patches

Azure Sentinel(SIEM+SOAR tool): Cloud Native event management solution (collect, detect, investigate and respond)

Section2: Design for Identiy and Security
 
    Design identiy management
        Choose an identiy management approach
        Design an identity delegation strategy, identity repository (including directory, applications,systems)
        Design self-service identiy management and user and persona provisioing
        Defining persona and roles
        Recommend appropriate access control and strategy 
                Attribute-based
                discretionary access
                history-based
                identity-based
                mandatory
                organization-based
                role-based
                rule-based
                responsibility-based

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) contains mostly 3 sections, PIM is a premium feature that enables you to limit standing admin and Privileged roles(Assign -->Activate --> Approve -->Adudit)
    MyRoles
    MyRequest: request the access for certain services
    ApproveRequest: approve that user access request
    ReviewAccess: prediocally review those access request

    Design authentication: Design authentication workflow 

    * Study different authentication methods for application running in Azure (Azure Connect, OpenID and OAuth, SAML, B2B, B2C, Passthrough authentication)

    Choose an authentication approach
    
     Choose an authentication approach
     Define access permission and privileges 
     Design secure delegated access (OAuth,OpenID)
     Recommend when and how to use API Keys
       Tip: familiar with Role Based Access Control (RBAC), like creating a new custom role for starting and stopping a VM use the following role, custom role has the ability to define actions, not actions and AssignableScopes for different subscriptions etc.,
    
    Design a Single Sign-on approach
    Design for IPSec
    Logon
    MFA
    Network access
    Remote authentication

    Design authorization
    Design for risk prevention for identity

        Design a risk assessment strategy (access review, RBAC, policies, physical access, etc.,)
        Evaluate agreements involving services or products from vendors and contractors
        update solution design documentation to address and mitigate changes to existing security policies, standards, guidelines and procedures 
      
        Risk management and risk prevention can be find in the activity logs in each resource groupId1

        Activity Log: performed by a user or a subscription etc., when and where the action was taken user who initated the action 

    Design a monitoring strategy for identity and security

        Design for alert notifications
        Design an alert and metrics strategy
        Recommend authentication monitors 

            activity directory: Identity side 
                Audit logs
                logs
                provisioing logs
                Diagnostic diagnosticSettings
            Azure Monitor: we can configure the Alerts and Metrics where we can configure different serivces 

Section3:    Design a Monitoring strategy for the data platform

                    Design for alert notification
                    Design an alert and metics strategy
